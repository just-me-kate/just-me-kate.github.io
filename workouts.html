						<h1>Do a break for a meditation</h1>
						<p>Meditation helps to more easily let go of fears, pain, and resentment stimulates brain activity, increases the level of concentration and attention. Find from 5 to 10 minutes and do such a break 3 or 4 times a day. That will help you to reduce stress and recharge your batteries. After practice, both hemispheres of the brain begin to work in a balanced way - this brings order to your life.</p>

						<h1>Go for a walk</h1>
						<p>Take your husband and kids and go out for a walk. Physical activity combined with a walk in nature helps to strengthen the immune system, even during cold periods. Daily walks improve the work of the heart and blood vessels, and lower blood pressure. But remember that fat begins to burn only after 40 minutes of walking. Therefore, in order to lose weight in this way, you need to walk for more than one hour a day. In the future, the time can be increased to two or even three hours, but it is better to start with small intervals. For example, in the summer I walk for three to four hours, but at first it was hard to walk more than 30 minutes.</p>
