						<h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
						<p> My name is Kate and I am fond of sport! Several years ago I looked at the mirror and was horrified. The girl that looked at me had a lot of extra weight, pimples on the face, and bags under the eyes. At that moment I understood that I need to change something in my life. Since then I am constantly working on my shape, eat healthy food, and change my old habits to new ones. If you are not satisfied with your current well-being, or your shape and you want to change it - my website is what you are looking for! Here I am going to share information about my life experience, simple but effective exercises that can be done at home, and, of course, provide information about healthy food. I hope that you will find a lot of interesting and useful information, and very soon change for the better! </p>
